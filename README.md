#   🎮 Pong Game: Player vs AI Bot  

A Python-based **Pong game** where a player competes against an AI-powered bot. The AI bot uses **trajectory prediction** to anticipate the ball's movement and respond effectively.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Single-player mode**: Play against an intelligent AI bot.  
- **AI Trajectory Prediction**: The bot predicts the ball’s future position and moves accordingly.    
- **Game Win Condition**: First to reach the winning score wins the match.  
- **Simple UI with Pygame**: Classic Pong-style visuals with a responsive interface.  

## 🧠 AI Bot Mechanism  
The AI bot is a **rule-based agent** that performs three key tasks:  
1. **Perception**: Detects ball position and movement.  
2. **Prediction**: Calculates the expected trajectory of the ball.  
3. **Action**: Moves the paddle to intercept the ball optimally.
